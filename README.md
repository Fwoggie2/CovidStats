# CovidStats
Basic excel analysis of John Hopkins University's daily stat crunching.

This github data source has taken the John Hopkins University data relating to the global Covid-19 outbreak (found at http://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/) and extrapolated it further into a hopefully easy to understand Excel analysis (at a very basic statistic level).
